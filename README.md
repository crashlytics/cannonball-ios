## Fabric

Cannonball is a canonical sample iOS app to demonstrate how to use [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/), the easiest way to build the best apps.

Cannonball uses many of the features available in Fabric, including Crashlytics, Answers, Sign In with Twitter and Phone Number via Digits, Embedded Timelines with the Twitter Kit as well as the Tweet Composer to share on Twitter, and finally Native Ads from MoPub.

## Getting Started

To get started and run the app, you need to follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Cannonball project with Xcode.
2. Sign up for Fabric on [fabric.io](https://fabric.io).
3. Download and install the Fabric Mac app.
4. Sign in with your Fabric account, select the Cannonball Xcode project and choose an organization.
5. Install Crashlytics, Digits, Twitter and MoPub Kits from the Mac app.
6. You're all set! Run Cannonball on your iPhone or the iOS Simulator.

Please note that in order to display Native Ads from MoPub on the History screen, you will need to insert your MoPub Ad Unit ID in `PoemHistoryViewController.swift`.

## Compatibility

This project is written in Swift. The code has been converted to Swift 2.0 so Cannonball now requires Xcode 7 to build and run.

Cannonball for iOS is compatible with iOS 7+.
